We are looking for a motivated and passionate Graphic Designer to join our team at GrowthHit. You will work on multiple client projects to support our team in driving results and growth for clients.

You have a solid understanding of both growth marketing and strong design principles. You thrive in a culture that celebrates iterative design processes (meaning: Many ideas, many revisions, lots of creative input — all in the name of shaping the best possible idea). You are detail-oriented and find great pleasure in being guided by brand systems. You love experimentation and optimizing your work based off results. You’re a culture junkie and have your hands on the pulse of what’s current in marketing, design, and the digital landscape. You must love start-up culture, feel energized by team-oriented environments, and have an all-hands-on-deck attitude.

This will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (Yes, really) to learn from a team with successful experience in growing startups. A part of the role is for you to develop your skills, experience, and grow into more responsibility over time.
