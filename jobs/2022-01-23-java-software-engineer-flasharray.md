**BE PART OF BUILDING THE FUTURE**

What do NASA and emerging space companies have in common with COVID vaccine R&D teams or with Roblox and the Metaverse? 

The answer is data, -- all fast-moving, fast-growing industries rely on data for a competitive edge in their industries. And the most advanced companies are realizing the full data advantage by partnering with Pure Storage. Pure’s vision is to redefine the storage experience and empower innovators by simplifying how people consume and interact with data. With 9,000 customers including 50% of the Fortune 500, we’ve only scratched the surface of our ambitions. 

Pure is blazing trails and setting records:

For eight straight years, Gartner has named Pure a leader in the Magic Quadrant 
Our customer-first culture and unwavering commitment to innovation have earned us a certified Net Promoter Score in the top 1% of B2B companies globally
Industry analysts and press applaud Pure’s leadership across these dimensions
And, our 4,000+ employees are emboldened to make Pure a faster, stronger, smarter company as we go
If you, like us, say “bring it on” to exciting challenges that change the world, we have endless opportunities where you can make your mark.

Pure in Prague

We opened our R&D Second Home (besides the one in Silicon Valley) in Prague in January 2020 and since then we have experienced unbelievable growth. Our Engineers are solving complex engineering problems (from low-level system software to cloud computing) that help us innovate our cutting-edge products. Besides our world-class Software Engineering teams, we have many other talented colleagues working in Product Management, Sales, Finance, and HR to name a few. What’s more, we’ve developed these teams from talent across the globe.

FlashArray Team

The FlashArray team builds the industry’s most innovative, high-performance, and highly available portfolio of products, that are designed for the most demanding mission-critical applications.  While we deliver a hardware storage array, over 90% of our engineering staff are software engineers. Our customers are the most important part of our business and they love FlashArray for its simplicity of management, the constant flow of new and exciting upgrades, and the ability to live on the cutting edge of technology while never taking downtime, ever. Most recently, we extended the value of our FlashArray capabilities into the cloud with CloudSnap and Cloud Block Store for AWS. These new innovations enable our customers to leverage the agility of the public cloud for both traditional IT and cloud-native applications.

What you'll be doing:

Design and implement creative new algorithms and technologies for high-performance, highly reliable systems (think six 9’s)
Own and deliver innovative end-to-end, from concept to shipped product
Analyze and solve challenging problems through persistence and insight
Work as a team with smart peers who inspire you and who are inspired by you
Make customers really happy, because that’s why we do what we do
Learn a ton, whether you know a lot or nothing about system software
What you'll need to bring to this role:

Full lifecycle software application development
3+ years experience designing software applications using various software languages, including Java, Python, C++ on Linux / UNIX platforms
Performing software analysis, including requirements, software review, system risks, performance, and reliability
Backend-related development at scale (SQL, APIs, concurrency)
Technical knowledge of virtualisation techniques and tools, e.g. VMware or Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM)
Natural curiosity with proven design sensibility and willingness to work in a collaborative, team-oriented environment
Must be willing and able to work in an open office environment
A BS degree in Computer Science; Advanced degrees are a bonus!
Understanding of storage technologies would be a plus 
Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would be a plus.
