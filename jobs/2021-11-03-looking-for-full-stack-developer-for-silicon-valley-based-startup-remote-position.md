Clarity, the app for your love life is looking for a full-stack developer to spearhead the dev team. We’re an early-stage Silicon Valley-based tech startup that’s about to go-to-market/scale. We’re seeking a trailblazer—someone who’s driven and hungry to make their mark in this world through building an impactful platform. They will work alongside the founder and management team to oversee day-to-day development and overall strategy in an adaptive and agile startup environment. If you enjoy the rewarding challenge of building and growing a brand and making an impact in the lives of people for generations to come, we'd love to hear from you.
 
Clarity is revolutionizing the dating and relationship world as the “the app for your love life”. Despite our love life being one of the greatest influences on our mental health, up until now, there hasn't been a go-to platform that helps us navigate it. Clarity is a relationship wellness app that encourages real, unfiltered conversation and taps into the wisdom of 50+ renowned experts to help the world build happier, healthier, and successful relationships. 
 
We launched our beta, and have already been featured in many news outlets like Forbes, Entrepreneur Magazine, Refinery29, Yahoo News, Thrive Global, Disrupt, Today Show, and many others. 
 
The app is built on React Native, so we are ideally looking for an engineer who specializes in GraphQL and Typescript. Engineers with experience and knowledge of all three technologies are preferred.
